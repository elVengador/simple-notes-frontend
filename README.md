**This personal project was initiated in early 2021 to showcase the skills and implementations I had at that time.** It's a simple note app organized by tags. While not actively supported, it reflects my past abilities.

Reviewing the code in 2023, I realize there are many things to improve. This is the first version. Check out Version 3, "Royal Palace," for significant upgrades.
